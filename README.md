## Description

This project is meant to create a weather app for any city that is looked up in the search bar. You start by searching for the desired city on the left side bar, and the search will populate in the remainder of the web page. It will display a large card with the current weather conditions. Underneath the main card it will display 5 future forecasts of the next five days of the weather conditions.


### Lessons Learned

This was  very different project from others, and was the first time utilizing API Keys. Console logging throughout the project is helpful to understand where you are at and what is working. Fixing the issues as they arise makes it easier to debug the code you are working with.
